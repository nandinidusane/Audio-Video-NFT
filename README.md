# Audio-Video-Compatible-NFT Marketplace

Welcome to the Audio-Video-Compatible-NFT Marketplace, a decentralized NFT trading platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain. This marketplace allows users to mint, buy, sell, and view non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with ease. Below, you'll find essential information on how to set up and use this platform.

## Introduction
The Audio-Video-Compatible-NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that leverages the ICP blockchain to provide users with fast and cost-effective NFT transactions. It offers a user-friendly interface, secure transactions through ICP-compatible wallets, and smart contracts designed specifically for NFTs on the ICP network.

## Functionality
The platform provides the following key functionalities:

- **Mint NFTs:** Users can mint new NFTs by uploading video or audio files and specifying a name and price. Minted NFTs are stored in the user's account.

- **List NFTs for Sale:** Users can list their minted NFTs for sale, making them available for purchase by other users.

- **Purchase NFTs:** Users can browse the marketplace and purchase NFTs listed by other users. Ownership of the purchased NFTs is transferred to the buyer.

- **View Owned NFTs:** Users can view and manage the NFTs they own, including the option to relist them for sale.

## Key Functions
The core functions of the marketplace's smart contract include:

- `MintProduct`: Minting a new NFT to the caller's address, accepting a file link, name, and price as parameters.

- `BuyProducts`: Allowing buyers to purchase multiple listed NFTs, transferring ownership to the buyer.

- `GetAllProducts`: Returning metadata of all minted NFTs on the contract, used to display listings.

- `Resale`: Allowing NFT owners to relist their NFTs for sale, accepting a new price as a parameter.
